Open Sky - neural networks procedurally generated game universe

Open Sky is a game where Solar Systems are explored, bonus points are given for collecting rare objects or identifying strange animals or geographic features on alien planetary systems.

Open Sky's uses neural networks trained on life that has evolved on Earth and possible life for alternate environments will genreate and evolutionary procedure for each planet type, i.e. size, makeup, gravity. 

A neural net trained on planet features on earth and how that might vary on alien planets will procedurally generate the planets. For the purpose of the game each solar system will contain some life.

Space stations and planet colonies will allow to obtain access to news, other players and higher civilsations and technology. For instance longer range of transporter, better ships access to worm hole transport accross galaxies.
